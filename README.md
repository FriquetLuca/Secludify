# Secludify

This is a wrapper around fastify for people that can't use HTTPS but want to securely send data anyway.
In `examples` directory, you'll find an example of frontend page using a secure implementation.
This is a work in progress that may be forgotten rapidly, you'll have an easier time just forking the project if you want to do something yourself.
See the code on [github](https://github.com/FriquetLuca/Secludify).
